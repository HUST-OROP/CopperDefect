##### ***Abstract***

Particle defects on cathodic copper plate surface always happen due to the immaturity of electrolytic copper processing. The removal of defects mainly depends on their height exceeding the plate and current removal requires manual measurement and operation, which is time-consuming and laborious. To automate the removal process, machine vision-based defect detection methods need to be developed. However, copper defects are in very small size, which increases the difficulty of feature extraction and prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Anchor-based Detection and Height Estimation (ADHE) framework, to locates the defect out and estimates the height of the defect in an end-to-end way. Large scale raw images are transformed into several image blocks as input. Defect features are obtained by Defect Region Extraction Network and then sent into Height-RCNN for defect detection and height prediction. Dataset of cathodic copper plate surface defects have been collected from a real-world manufacturing factory. Experimental results show that the proposed ADHE method can effectively address the small size problem of copper defects and achieve excellent results on detection and height estimation.
